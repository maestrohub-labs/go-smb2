// client

// clientCapabilities are advertised in the NEGOTIATE request. SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_DFS
// is included unconditionally — exactly as Windows, cifs.ko, and smbclient do —
// because Windows servers only enable DFS processing (returning
// STATUS_PATH_NOT_COVERED on a DFS link, which drives transparent referral
// following) for clients that negotiated the DFS capability. The per-request
// SMB2_FLAGS_DFS_OPERATIONS header flag is necessary but NOT sufficient: without
// the negotiated capability the server serves the bare DFS reparse stub instead
// of signalling the referral. Advertising it is harmless for non-DFS sessions —
// the server takes no DFS action unless an individual request also carries the
// SMB2_FLAGS_DFS_OPERATIONS flag, which only happens when a Dialer set EnableDFS
// (see dfs_mount.go createFile). Conn.capabilities masks this against the
// server's advertised set, so the bit survives only when the server supports DFS.
